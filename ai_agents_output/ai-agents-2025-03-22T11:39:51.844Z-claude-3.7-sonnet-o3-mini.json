Claude stands out for its 100K token input limit, its uniquely transparent approach to AI safety with a “constitution”, and for the free access to the best Claude model developed yet, Claude-2. [...] Currently, Anthropic offers three “Claude” models: Claude 1, Claude 2, and Claude-Instant. While all are language-only models, each has subtle differences in capability. Claude is regularly trained on up-to-date information, and can read up to 75,000 words at a time.

[...] Where other models have their content reviewed by human trainers in a process called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), Claude’s was trained with RLHF as well as a second AI model. Reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) tasked the “trainer” model with comparing Claude’s behavior against Constitutional AI and correcting it accordingly.
