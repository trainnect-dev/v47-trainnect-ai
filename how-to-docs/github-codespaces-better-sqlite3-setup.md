### Step 1: Verify better-sqlite3 Installation in Codespaces
1. **Check if better-sqlite3 is listed in package.json dependencies:**
   - Open the `package.json` file in your project.
   - Ensure that `better-sqlite3` is listed under `dependencies`. For example:
     ```json
     {
       "dependencies": {
         "better-sqlite3": "^7.6.12", // March 2025 latest
         // other dependencies...
       }
     }
     ```

2. **Ensure the version of better-sqlite3 is compatible with the project:**
   - Verify that the version specified in `package.json` is compatible with your project's Node.js version and other dependencies.

### Step 2: Configure Codespaces for better-sqlite3 Usage
1. **Check devcontainer.json for better-sqlite3 setup instructions:**
   - Open the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file in your project (create it if it doesn't exist).
   - Ensure that `better-sqlite3` is included in the setup instructions. For example:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "My Project",
       "dockerFile": "Dockerfile",
       "settings": {
         "terminal.integrated.shell.linux": "/bin/bash"
       },
       "extensions": [
         "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint",
         "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
       ],
       "postCreateCommand": "npm install"
     }
     ```

2. **Verify Dockerfile or Docker setup for SQLite3 dependencies:**
   - Open the `Dockerfile` in your project (create it if it doesn't exist).
   - Ensure that SQLite3 dependencies are installed. For example:
     ```Dockerfile
     FROM node:14

     # Install SQLite3 dependencies
     RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev

     # Set the working directory
     WORKDIR /usr/src/app

     # Copy the package.json and install dependencies
     COPY package*.json ./
     RUN npm install

     # Copy the rest of the application code
     COPY . .

     # Expose the application port
     EXPOSE 3000

     # Start the application
     CMD ["npm", "start"]
     ```

### Follow-up Steps
- **Explain how to initialize and use better-sqlite3 once Codespaces setup is confirmed:**
  - Once the Codespaces setup is confirmed, you can initialize and use `better-sqlite3` as shown in your provided `lib/db/server.ts` file.
  - Ensure that the database path is correctly set to a writable location within the Codespaces environment.

- **Provide a sample configuration or initialization script for better-sqlite3 in a Codespaces environment:**
  - Here is a sample script to initialize `better-sqlite3` in Codespaces:
    ```javascript
    import Database from 'better-sqlite3';
    import path from 'path';

    // Initialize database in the db directory
    const dbPath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'db', 'chat-history.db');
    const db = new Database(dbPath);

    // Enable WAL mode for better performance
    db.pragma('journal_mode = WAL');

    // Create messages table if it doesn't exist
    db.exec(`
      CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS messages (
        id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
        role TEXT NOT NULL,
        content TEXT NOT NULL,
        timestamp INTEGER NOT NULL,
        conversation_id TEXT NOT NULL,
        chat_type TEXT NOT NULL,
        metadata TEXT
      );
      CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_conversation_timestamp 
      ON messages(conversation_id, timestamp);
      CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_chat_type 
      ON messages(chat_type);
    `);

    // Prepare statements for better performance
    const stmts = {
      insertMessage: db.prepare(`
        INSERT INTO messages (id, role, content, timestamp, conversation_id, chat_type, metadata)
        VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
      `),
      
      getMessagesByConversation: db.prepare(`
        SELECT * FROM messages 
        WHERE conversation_id = ?
        ORDER BY timestamp ASC
      `),
      
      getAllConversations: db.prepare(`
        SELECT DISTINCT conversation_id, 
        MIN(timestamp) as start_time,
        COUNT(*) as message_count,
        chat_type,
        MAX(CASE WHEN metadata IS NOT NULL THEN metadata ELSE NULL END) as metadata
        FROM messages 
        GROUP BY conversation_id 
        ORDER BY start_time DESC
      `),

      getConversationsByType: db.prepare(`
        SELECT DISTINCT conversation_id, 
        MIN(timestamp) as start_time,
        COUNT(*) as message_count,
        chat_type,
        MAX(CASE WHEN metadata IS NOT NULL THEN metadata ELSE NULL END) as metadata
        FROM messages 
        WHERE chat_type = ?
        GROUP BY conversation_id 
        ORDER BY start_time DESC
      `),
    };

    export { db, stmts };
    ```

By following these steps, you should be able to utilize `better-sqlite3` in GitHub Codespaces for your project.
